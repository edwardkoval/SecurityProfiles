# Alert resource type

Alerts represent potential security issues within a customer's tenant that have been identified by Microsoft or partner security solutions. Alerts can be used to unify and streamline alert management across all integrated solutions. See sample queries in [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer).

For Public Preview (April 2018), Alerts can be retrieved from the following Providers: **Azure Security Center**, and **Azure Active Directory Identity Protection**. Additional Alert Providers will integrate in the following months.
